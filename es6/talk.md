### ES6 @ edX

![](assets/es6.png)

---

#### The JS ecosystem in 2016

- React
- Redux
- Flow
- Jest
- Elm
- Webpack
- CommonJS
- Typescript
- ESLint
- Babel
- Mithril
- Vue
- Ramda
- Electron
- JSX
- CSS Modules
- ESNext
- Angular 2

---

"You need to rebuild your app in isomorphic Mithril with pure functional stateless components and IcedLatteScript."

---

... Why?

---

"Because it's the *future*!"

---

#### ES6 is not any of those things.

- the next generation of the Javascript you already know
- works with existing tools, doesn't add any complexity to development process
- All the same stuff you already know how to do, just:
  - cleaner
  - easier
  - more predictable

---

#### Terminology
- ES6 === ECMAScript 6 === ES2015 === ECMAScript 2015
- ES7 === ES2016
- ES2016 !== ES6
- TC39 favors year nomenclature to emphasize rolling spec
- Most people in the community still call it ES6


---
#### `let` and `const`

---
#### Function expressions

---
#### Classes

---
#### Destructuring

---
#### Template strings


---
#### More highlights

- `Object.keys` / `Object.values`
- `Array.includes`
- `for (... of ...)`
- `Map` / `Set`
- Modules

---
#### Browsers

- Browser vendors are slow.
- ES6 spec was finalized in 2015, most "good" browsers implement 80%+ of spec
- Outliers: Safari 8, IE11


Notes: The only thing that's consistent among all the different browsers is that they're all slow to implement new features

---
#### Babel

- "Transpiles" ES6 into ES5
- uses **presets** - target specific features, or a spec version
- Tightly integrated with tools like RequireJS, Karma, etc
  - No need to generate .`gitignore`d local files

---
#### Community support
- Most industry giants are using ES6
- Most code schools are teaching it


---
## Summary
- Think less Coffeescript, more Python 3 or C++ 14
- Lets us build faster, easier, and with less head-scratching
- Aligns us with the community
- One of the most significant things we can do to modernize Javascript at edX
